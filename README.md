# Incentive-protocol

The idea is to create a protocol in which we have a set of a smart contracts that let businesses create exclusive deals as NFTs. 
That NFT should also be renewable, that's why we will call them subscription NFTs.

That subscription NFT should be verifiable in-store and have an expiration. 

The idea is to also have an "incentive rate", or a number that can descrive for example a discount rate on a specific product or service. 

For this protocol it's important to reduce fees and and be scalable as our main focus is mass adoption. Starknet is a great technology to build scalable decentralized applications.
